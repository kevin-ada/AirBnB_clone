Requirements:
1. First step: Write a command interpreter to manage
your AirBnB objects.
First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application:
the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important
because you will use what you build during this project
with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating,
database storage, API, front-end integration…
	Each task is linked and will help you to:
put in place a parent class (called BaseModel)
to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization
of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization:
Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…)
that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage
engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all
our classes and storage engine
